# rtest001 - Ubuntu Testing for C Programming and Website Development

## About
This repository, `rtest001`, is dedicated to my exploration of Ubuntu as a hobbyist and beginner. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with **C programming** and **website development** using online tools and resources. The goal is to learn, test, and document my progress in these areas while leveraging Ubuntu's open-source environment.

## Purpose
- **C Programming**: Practice writing, compiling, and running C programs in an Ubuntu environment.
- **Website Development**: Experiment with web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and online development tools to build simple websites.
- **Learning Ubuntu**: Explore Ubuntu's tools, command-line interface, and development ecosystem as a beginner.

## Contents
- **C Programs**: Source code files written in C, including examples and practice projects.
- **Web Development**: Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for creating and testing simple web pages.
- **Scripts and Tools**: Shell scripts or configuration files used to set up and manage the Ubuntu environment for development.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Ubuntu**: An Ubuntu-based system (local or cloud-based) to run and test the code.
- **C Compiler**: Install `gcc` for compiling C programs (`sudo apt install gcc`).
- **Web Browser**: A modern browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome) for testing web pages.
- **Text Editor**: Use editors like `nano`, `vim`, or VS Code for coding.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AV971978/rtest001.git
   cd rtest001
